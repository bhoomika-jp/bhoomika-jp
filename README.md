### 👨‍💻 Data Projects I've Made:

## Predicting House Prices 
This project aims to predict house prices on a given data set with 80 predictors. I have utilized pandas, numpy and scikit-learn to preprocess the data and train and test a gradient boosting regressor model. Documented in Jupyter notebook

## IMDB Sentiment Analysis
This project aims to classify movie reviews as positive or negative. I have utilized NLP techniques and Python libraries (NLTK and Scikit-Learn) to accurately classify user sentiments. Utilized GPU and documented in Google Colab. 

## GDP Data Analysis in Python
This project aims to analyze GDP of all the countries over 100 years and derive valuable insights and conclusions using data analysis and visualizations in Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn)
