### Hey! I'm Bhoomika 👋
#### I am currently a data engineer with over 1 year of experience in building and monitoring ETL pipelines in SAP Data Services (utilising dimensional modelling concepts), and creating and maintaining semantic models and reports in Power BI. I am passionate about machine learning and AI which was my focus while obtaining a Masters in Business Analytics from the University of Utah. For my capstone, my team developed a time-series forecasting model for Maverik which won first place in a case competition. 

#### I enjoy answering complex questions and solving problems using different kinds of data analysis techniques and machine learning. I especially enjoy building prediction models and aspire to be an ML Engineer. I am currently learning and working on building and deploying an AI app on a cloud platform.

#### Work that I am proud of includes 'Maverik Time-Series Forecasting', 'House Prices Prediction' and 'World Life Expectancy Data Analysis' among others that are listed below. Feel free to check them out by following the links. My professional goals include solving important problems using machine learning and artificial intelligence.

### 👨‍💻 [My Data Projects](https://github.com/bhoomika-jp/Portfolio/tree/main#portfolio):

## Machine Learning (Python)

- [Maverik Time-Series Forecasting](https://github.com/bhoomika-jp/Maverik-Sales-Forecasting): Project assigned and data provided by Maverik. Time series analysis and rolling forecast of sales for a new Maverik store's first year of sales, incorporating seasonality using Prophet. MSBA case competition winner.
- [House Prices Prediction](https://github.com/bhoomika-jp/Predicting-House-Prices): Predicted house prices on a given data set with 80 predictors. I have utilized pandas, numpy and scikit-learn to preprocess the data and train and test a gradient boosting regressor model. Documented in Jupyter notebook. Data from kaggle.
- [Image Classification Hugging Face](https://github.com/bhoomika-jp/Image_Classification_Hugging_Face/tree/main): Learned how to classify images using visions transformers and other computer vision tools, following a tutorial on Data Camp.
- [Movie Reviews Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/bhoomika-jp/Movie-Reviews-Sentiment-Analysis): Machine learning model for sentiment analysis on IMDb movie reviews, utilizing NLP techniques and Python libraries (NLTK and Scikit-Learn) to accurately classify user sentiment as positive or negative.
- [Iris Classification](https://github.com/bhoomika-jp/Machine_Learning_Mastery/blob/main/Iris__ML.ipynb): Iris flower classification based on its features.
  
## Data Analysis 

### SQL
- [World Life Expectancy (Data Cleaning and Analysis)](https://github.com/bhoomika-jp/World-Life-Expectancy): Cleaned the data in MySQL, handling missing values, calculating new columns etc. and then used the transformed data to carry out exploratory data analysis, finding insights into which countries have the highest and lowest life expectancies by GDP, Developed vs. Developing, BMI etc.

### Python
- [GDP Data Analysis](https://github.com/bhoomika-jp/GDP-Data-Analysis): Analyzed GDP for all the countries over 100 years and derived valuable insights and conclusions using data analysis and visualizations in Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn). Gapminder dataset. 
- [Video Games Sales Analysis](https://github.com/bhoomika-jp/Video-Games-Sales-Analysis): Analyzed video games sales data and derived valuable insights and recommendations using data analysis and visualizations in Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn). Kaggle dataset. 
- [Netflix Data Analysis](https://github.com/bhoomika-jp/MSBA-Coursework/blob/main/Netflix/Bhoomika_Final_Project.ipynb): My first ever data analysis in python using pandas, numpy and matplotlib. Completed for a beginner python class during MSBA. 
  

## Data Visualization (Power BI, Tableau)

- <ins>Suicide Death Rates by Age, Race and Sex </ins>: Analyzed and visualized in Power BI. Found that people over the age of 85 and white males have consistently had the highest rate of suicide deaths between 1950 and 2018. Suicide death rates have also significantly gone up for the ages 15 to 54 over the last 20 years. Data from data.gov.
- <ins>Foundation Shades Annalysis</ins>: Analyzed and visualized in Power BI. Compared brands that offer lighter shades of foundations vs darker shades or if they offer an evenly distributed shades of foundation. Data from data.world.
